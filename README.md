## About

I want to write automated UI-test cases for an application written in Scala that uses [ScalaFX](http://www.scalafx.org). OK, any ScalaFX application is somehow also a JavaFX application. Fortunatly I have found [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX). TestFX is a great framework to test the UI of JavaFX applications. It provides a DSL for controlling and assertion of a JavaFX-application. The DSL is as good as it can get in Java and JUnit.

The application to be tested is written in Scala. Consequently I want to write the test cases in Scala too. I decided to use [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org).

That was the birth of ScalaTestFX. A small framework to use the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library in test cases written as [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org) specifications.

ScalaTest + TestFX = ScalaTextFX
